    <p dir="ltr">The Toronto Carnival Guide was launched 5 years ago, a small project that has grown into something spectacular. &nbsp;Now in our 5th year we have evolved into &ldquo;Carnival Guide Intl.&rdquo;. Carnival Guide Intl. is the ultimate resource for visitors and residents, as it covers everything they need to know about what to do, what to see, how to travel, and where to eat during the weeks of Carnival in Toronto ( Canada), Barbados, Guyana and St. Lucia. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">Our Cover Model contest has become one of the most popular and is eagerly anticipated. Last year our contest ran for 3 weeks and received over 124,000K views. This year we are launching contests in Barbados, Guyana and St. Lucia.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">It has been an eventful 5 years and we have built great relationships along the way. We provide our partners with maximum return on investment and the opportunity to participate in these world renowned festivals. </p>
